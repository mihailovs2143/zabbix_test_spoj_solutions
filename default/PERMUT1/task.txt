PERMUT1 - Permutations
#dynamic-programming

Let A = [a1, a2 ... an] be a permutation of integers 1, 2 ... n. A pair of indices (i, j), 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, is an inversion of the permutation A if ai > aj. We are given integers n > 0 and k ≥ 0. What is the number of n-element permutations containing exactly k inversions?

For instance, the number of 4-element permutations with exactly 1 inversion equals 3.
Task

Write a program which for each data set from a sequence of several data sets:

    reads integers n and k from input,
    computes the number of n-element permutations with exactly k inversions,
    writes the result to output.

Input

The first line of the input file contains one integer d, 1 ≤ d ≤ 10, which is the number of data sets. The data sets follow. Each data set occupies one line of the input file and contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 12) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 98) separated by a single space.
Output

The i-th line of the output file should contain one integer - the number of n-element permutations with exactly k inversions.
Example

Input:
1
4 1

Output:
3
